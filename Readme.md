# **Working:**

-   The Compiler class does all the work and runs Lexer -> Parser -> Virtual Machine.
-   Just run the main of the Compiler class.
-   Lexer reads from Input.exe and writes tokens in Output.txt.
-   Parser reads the tokens from Output.txt and produces: symboltable.txt, tac.txt and parsetree.txt.
-   Virtual machines reads from tac.txt and symboltable.txt to run the code on the terminal.
